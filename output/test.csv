Research 
The narrow-leaved lavantula, the common lavender and the lavantula the stoichas, known as 
myrrh-bearing and wild lavender, belong to the family of Lips and to the category of aroma=c 
plants.  
They are perennial bushy plants, have leaves elongated, slightly fluffy rather fleshy and silvery 
color. Their characteris=c difference is their flowering, where in the first the flowers are lip-
shaped, violet and are located in sparse, extreme inflorescence, while in the wild they are violet 
and are located in extreme, dense ears. They bloom in spring, the first in gardens, and the 
second in dry lands, stony soils and rivers in the semi-mountainous areas of our island.  
The lavantula stoichas is a na=ve plant of the Mediterranean countries and is men=oned by Pliny 
and Dioscorides, ornamental lavender is a hybrid of wild. Today there are several ornamental 
varie=es, cul=vated for their essen=al oil, although the highest quality oil is that given by the
